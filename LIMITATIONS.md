# Scalability Limitations of the Integration.app Webhook Service

## Overview

The current FastAPI-based webhook receiver is well-suited for development and mild usage. It is not architected to handle high-throughput scenarios like 10,000–100,000 requests per second. This document outlines the technical limitations and tries to provide some recommendations at the end.

---

## 1. In-Process Background Task Limitations

### Current Approach
 FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to simulate processing by sleeping for 5 seconds.

### Why It Fails at Scale

* Background tasks run in the same memory space as the web server.
* If the app crashes, all in-progress tasks are lost.
* Consumes CPU and RAM on the main server, quickly becoming a bottleneck.

---

## 2. SQLite Database Bottleneck

### Current Setup

* SQLite with a mounted file path (e.g., `/data/webhooks.db`) for persistence.

### Why It Fails at Scale

* SQLite allows only one write at a time which leads to lock contention under load.
* File-based DBs don’t scale well on cloud instances or containers.
* No built-in connection pooling or replication support.
* Is I/O-bound. Will struggle under high frequency inserts.

---

## 3. Lack of Message Queue or Buffering

### Problem

* There's no queue (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka) between ingestion and processing.

### Why It Matters

* No mechanism to absorb spikes.
* All processing must finish quickly or risk timing out HTTP clients.
* No retry if tasks fail.

---

## 4. Single Instance Constraint

### Deployment Context

* Currently deployed as a single container on Render (Free Tier).

### Limitations

* No autoscaling.
* No multi-threaded job execution beyond what Uvicorn can provide.
* Can’t scale horizontally without queue + worker pattern.

---

## 5. No Load Balancing or API Gateway

* Traffic cannot be distributed across replicas [If we had replicas].
* No protection against traffic spikes, DDoS, or burst limits.

## Recommendation for Scale

| Component       | Upgrade To                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Background Task | Redis Queue / Celery          |
| Database        | PostgreSQL / DynamoDB         |
| Hosting         | Kubernetes / Fargate          |
| API Workers     | Gunicorn + Uvicorn Workers    |
| Observability   | Prometheus + Grafana          |

---

For high-availability and performance, the architecture should adopt an event-driven design with a queue, scalable workers, a real relational or NoSQL DB, and autoscaled containers.
